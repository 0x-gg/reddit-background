{"name":"reddit-background","tagline":"Set your Mac OS X desktop background to images pulled from Reddit ","body":"reddit-background\r\n=================\r\n\r\nSet your Mac OS X desktop background to images pulled from [Reddit](https://reddit.com)\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n- Supports multiple monitors\r\n- Handles multiple subreddits\r\n- Image resolution filtering ensures your backgrounds are always beautiful\r\n- Flexible sorting lets you choose the quality of images it downloads\r\n- Can pick images that match the current season\r\n\r\nTry It\r\n------\r\n\r\n1.  Download the project; or clone the repo using [git](http://git-scm.com/),\r\n    like:\r\n\r\n        git clone https://github.com/rconradharris/reddit-backgrounds.git\r\n\r\n2.  Run it:\r\n\r\n        cd reddit-background\r\n        ./reddit-background\r\n\r\nThe default is to use images based on the current season (`{seasonal}`), so\r\nfor example, if it’s November, the images will be pulled from\r\n    [/r/AutumnPorn](https://reddit.com/r/AutumnPorn).\r\n\r\nInstall It\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to install reddit-background is to copy it to\r\n`/usr/local/bin`. To do this, run this command:\r\n\r\n    cp reddit-background /usr/local/bin\r\n\r\nConfigure It\r\n------------\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to customize reddit-background so that it chooses images images\r\nfrom different subreddits, you can provide a configuration file at\r\n`~/.reddit-background.conf`. Here’s a sample to get you started:\r\n\r\n    # Default is used across all monitors, unless overriden with a more\r\n    # specific configuration\r\n    [default]\r\n\r\n    # {seasonal} will choose the correct subreddit based on the current season\r\n    subreddits={seasonal}\r\n\r\n    # Filter out any images with resolution below this\r\n    min_resolution=1280x1024\r\n\r\n    # Desktop 2 overrides the defaults to use images pulled from r/CarPorn and\r\n    # r/EarthPorn\r\n    [desktop2]\r\n    subreddits=CarPorn,EarthPorn\r\n\r\nAutomate It\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nOnce you have a configuration you like, you can set up reddit-background to\r\nrotate your background daily.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways to do this, but one way is to add it to your *crontab*.\r\n\r\nTo do this, open up your crontab in an editor:\r\n\r\n    crontab -e\r\n\r\nAnd once you’ve done that, add the following line:\r\n\r\n    0 9 * * * /usr/local/bin/reddit-background\r\n\r\nSave the file and quit the editor. Now your background will rotate daily at\r\n9:00 in the morning.\r\n\r\nAdvanced\r\n--------\r\n\r\n### Subreddit Sort Options\r\n\r\nBy default, when you specify a subreddit, you are selecting the top 25 posts\r\nover the last week.\r\n\r\nYou can customize the sort by using the following format:\r\n\r\n    <subreddit>:[sort]:[limit]:[timeframe]\r\n\r\n| Argument  | Possible Values                                        | Default |\r\n|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|\r\n| subreddit | A subreddit or {seasonal}                              | *None*  |\r\n| sort      | contraversial, gilded, hot, new, promoted, rising, top | top     |\r\n| limit     | An integer                                             | 25      |\r\n| timeframe | all, day, hour, month, week, year                      | week    |\r\n\r\nSo, for example, if you want to only include the 5 newest posts from\r\n[/r/EarthPorn](https://reddit.com/r/EarthPorn), you would write it as:\r\n\r\n    EarthPorn:new:5\r\n\r\nOr if you’d like to include the top 10 posts over the year for\r\n[/r/CityPorn](https://reddit.com/r/CityPorn), you’d write it as:\r\n\r\n    CityPorn:top:10:year\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Only the `top` and `controversial` sort methods use the `timeframe` option.\r\n\r\n### Dynamic Subreddits\r\n\r\nreddit-background can dynamically pull images from the correct subreddit based\r\non some criteria.\r\n\r\nThese are called 'dynamic subreddits' and they are specified just like normal\r\nexcept they are enclosed in curly-brackets.\r\n\r\nCurrently the only one included is `{seasonal}` which will choose from amongst\r\n[/r/WinterPorn](https://reddit.com/r/WinterPorn),\r\n[/r/SpringPorn](https://reddit.com/r/SpringPorn),\r\n[/r/SummerPorn](https://reddit.com/r/SummerPorn), or\r\n[/r/AutumnPorn](https://reddit.com/r/AutumnPorn) based on the current season\r\n(in the northern hemisphere).\r\n\r\n### Command-Line Usage\r\n\r\nIn addition to specifying a configuration file, you can also customize\r\nreddit-background directly from the command-line.\r\n\r\nThe arguments represent each subreddit you would like to pull images from. For\r\nexample, to pull seasonal images and images from\r\n[/r/CarPorn](https://reddit.com/r/CarPorn), you would run:\r\n\r\n    reddit-background {seasonal} CarPorn\r\n\r\nIf you have a multi-monitor setup, you can also set the background for a\r\nsingle monitor using the `--desktop` option like:\r\n\r\n    reddit-background --desktop 1 BeachPorn\r\n\r\nThis will set the background on desktop 1 to one of the 5 hottest posts from\r\n[/r/BeachPorn](https://reddit.com/r/BeachPorn).\r\n\r\nIf you already know the URL of the image you’d like to use, you can use the\r\n`--url` option to automatically download it and set it the background like::\r\n\r\n    reddit-background --url http://www.visit2ethiopia.com/images/Addis%20Ababa01.jpg\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
