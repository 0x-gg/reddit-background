Clone the repo:\r\n\r\n        git clone https://github.com/rconradharris/reddit-backgrounds.git\r\n\r\n2.  Run it:\r\n\r\n        cd reddit-background\r\n        ./reddit-background\r\n\r\nThe default is to use images based on the current season (`{seasonal}`), so for example, if it’s November, the images will be pulled from *r/AutumnPorn*.\r\n\r\nInstall It\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to install reddit-background is to copy it to `/usr/local/bin`. To do this run this command:\r\n\r\n    cp reddit-background /usr/local/bin\r\n\r\nConfigure It\r\n------------\r\n\r\nreddit-background lets you specify a configuration file so that you can customize which subreddits it pull images from.\r\n\r\nTo use a custom configuration, create a file at `~/.reddit-background.conf`. Here’s a sample to get you started:\r\n\r\n    # Default is used across all monitors, unless overriden with a more\r\n    # specific configuration\r\n    [default]\r\n\r\n    # {seasonal} will choose the correct subreddit based on the current season\r\n    subreddits={seasonal}\r\n\r\n    # Filter out any images with resolution below this\r\n    min_resolution=1280x1024\r\n\r\n    # Desktop 2 overrides the defaults to use images pulled from r/CarPorn and\r\n    # r/EarthPorn\r\n    [desktop2]\r\n    subreddits=CarPorn,EarthPorn\r\n\r\nAutomate It\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nOnce you have a configuration you like, you can set up reddit-background to rotate your background daily.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways to do this, but one way is to add it to your *crontab*.\r\n\r\nTo do this, open up your crontab in an editor:\r\n\r\n    crontab -e\r\n\r\nAnd once you’ve done that, add the following line:\r\n\r\n    0 9 * * * /usr/local/bin/reddit-background\r\n\r\nSave the file and quit the editor. Now your background will rotate daily at 9:00 in the morning.\r\n\r\nAdvanced\r\n--------\r\n\r\n### Subreddit Sort Options\r\n\r\nBy default, when you specify a subreddit, you are selecting the top 25 posts over the last week.\r\n\r\nYou can customize the sort by using the following format:\r\n\r\n    <subreddit>:[sort]:[limit]:[timeframe]\r\n\r\n| Argument  | Possible Values                                        | Default |\r\n|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|\r\n| subreddit | A subreddit or {seasonal}                              | *None*  |\r\n| sort      | contraversial, gilded, hot, new, promoted, rising, top | top     |\r\n| limit     | An integer                                             | 25      |\r\n| timeframe | all, day, hour, month, week, year                      | week    |\r\n\r\nSo, for example, if you want to only include the 5 newest posts from *r/EarthPorn*, you would write it as:\r\n\r\n    EarthPorn:new:5\r\n\r\nOr if you’d like to include the top 10 posts over the year for CarPorn, you’d write it as:\r\n\r\n    CarPorn:top:10:year\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Only the ‘top’ and ‘controversial’ sort methods use the `timeframe` option.\r\n\r\n### Dynamic Subreddits\r\n\r\nreddit-background can dynamically pull images from the correct subreddit based on some criteria.\r\n\r\nThey are specified just like normal subreddits except they are enclosed in curly-brackets.\r\n\r\nCurrently the only one included is `{seasonal}` which will choose from amongst *r/WinterPorn*, *r/SpringPorn*, *r/SummerPorn*, or *r/AutumnPorn* based on the current season (in the northern hemisphere).\r\n\r\n### Command-Line Usage\r\n\r\nIn addition to specifying a configuration file, you can also customize reddit-background directly from the command-line.\r\n\r\nThe arguments represent each subreddit you would like to pull images from. For example, to pull seasonal images and images from *r/CarPorn*, you would run:\r\n\r\n    reddit-background {seasonal} CarPorn\r\n\r\nIf you have a multi-monitor setup, you can also set the background for a single monitor using the `--desktop` option like:\r\n\r\n    reddit-background --desktop 1 CarPorn:hot:5\r\n\r\nThis will set the background on desktop 1 to one of the 5 hottest posts from *r/CarPorn*.\r\n\r\nIf you already know the URL of the image you’d like to use, you can use the `--url` to automatically download it and set it the background. For example:\r\n\r\n    reddit-background --url http://www.visit2ethiopia.com/images/Addis%20Ababa01.jpg\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n------\r\n\r\n-   Rick Harris \\<<rconradharris@gmail.com>\\>\r\n-   Twitter: [@rconradharris][]\r\n\r\n  [@rconradharris]: https://twitter.com/rconradharris\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
